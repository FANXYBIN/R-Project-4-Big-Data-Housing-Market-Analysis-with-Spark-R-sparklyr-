# R-Project-4-Big-Data-Housing-Market-Analysis-with-Spark-R-sparklyr-
This project uses Apache Spark (sparklyr) to analyze two large U.S. housing datasets:   Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) and the Annual House Price Index (HPI).   The analysis explores state-level home values, top/bottom ZIP codes, and multi-decade price trends using Spark for distributed data handling.
